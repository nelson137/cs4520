# Assignment 3

Milestone 0: CMake and Unit Testing filled out.
             (Due Friday, February 19,2021 11:59 PM)

Milestone 1: PCB file loading and First Come First Served.
             (Due Friday, February 26,2021 11:59 PM)

Milestone 2: Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time First, Round Robin, and analysis of algorithms.
             (Due Friday, March 5,2021 11:59 PM)

Note:
You can manually copy the time analysis from console and paste it to this readme file, but directly output from your program is strongly recommended.

## (FCFS) First Come, First Served

         Total runtime = 407
          Average wait = 199.733
    Average turnaround = 213.300

## (SJF) Shortest Job First

         Total runtime = 407
          Average wait = 104.633
    Average turnaround = 118.200

## (SRTF) Shortest Remaining Time First

*Best average wait and average turnaround.*

         Total runtime = 407
